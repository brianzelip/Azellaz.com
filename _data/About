About Azellaz

Azellaz produces handmade bags in Baltimore, Maryland. We have a strong committment to quality materials and are guided by a desire to create functional, beautiful bags that delight as they assist you in your everyday adventures. Most pieces are dyed by hand with natural dyes and waxed by hand with beeswax (white or yellow) before being sewn up. 

Care

Waxed canvas wears a bit like leather; its qualities will change over time, softening and developing a shiny patina. If your bag becomes too soft for your liking, you can stiffen it up by heating the canvas with a hair dryer. Hold the heat on each area until it darkens a bit, then reshape and allow to cool. This will also get rid of any scuff marks or creases.
