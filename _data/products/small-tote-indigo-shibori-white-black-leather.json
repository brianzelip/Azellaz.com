The base of the bag is made from English Bridle leather that is luxurious, water resistant, and durable; vegetable tanned in Pennsylvania by a company that was founded in 1867, from North American cattle. Includes all nickel-plated brass hardware and a Riri zipper.\n\n12.5 inches wide x 12.5 inches tall x 3.5 inches deep.",
