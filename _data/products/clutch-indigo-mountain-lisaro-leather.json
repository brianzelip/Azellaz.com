    "Great as an evening clutch, a small crossbody bag, a pouch for organizing in a larger bag, or all three! Fits the essentials (phone, credit cards, keys). I particularly love this bag for travel as it fits compactly in a suitcase and can be used for both nights out and minimalist day trips.",

    "Available with wrist strap, crossbody strap, or both. Make your selection from within the shopping cart."
