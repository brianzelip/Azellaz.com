  "descriptionShort": "Tote bag that converts to a backpack.",
  "body": "I call this the Everything Bag; not only can you fit pretty much your whole life into it (while maintaining a sleek silhouette), but it also transitions eaily between a tote and a backpack!\n\nThis bag also has two external pockets, from which an onion-skin dyed piece of felt peeks out. \n\nMade from wool felt with leather straps and all-brass hardware. The felt may pill slightly during the first week or so of wear, but simply remove pills with a lint remover (or your fingers) and this should soon subside. \n\nApproximate dimensions:",
