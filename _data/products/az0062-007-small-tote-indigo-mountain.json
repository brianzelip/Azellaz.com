  "body": "This minimalist tote has two outside pockets and a magnetic snap closure. Fits everything you'd want to carry on a daily basis - wallet, hardcover book, knitting project, extra scarf, etc.\n\nI dye each piece by hand with indigo and wax each piece with my own beeswax blend. The base of the bag is made from English Bridle leather that is luxurious, water resistant, and durable; vegetable tanned in Pennsylvania by a company that was founded in 1867, from North American cattle. Includes all nickel-plated brass hardware and a Riri zipper.\n\n12.5 inches wide x 12.5 inches tall x 3.5 inches deep.",
