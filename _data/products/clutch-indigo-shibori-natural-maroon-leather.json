  "body": "Great as an evening clutch, a small crossbody bag, a pouch for organizing in a larger bag, or all three! Fits the essentials (phone, credit cards, keys). I particularly love this bag for travel as it fits compactly in a suitcase and can be used for both nights out and minimalist day trips.\n\nEach piece is hand dyed with indigo and hand waxed with beeswax. The base of the bag is made from English Bridle leather which is luxurious, water resistant, and durable; vegetable tanned in Pennsylvania by a company that was founded in 1867, from North American cattle. Includes all brass hardware and a Riri zipper.\n\n7 inches wide x 4.5 inches tall x 1.5 inches deep.\n\nAvailable with wrist strap, crossbody strap, or both. Make your selection from within the shopping cart.",
