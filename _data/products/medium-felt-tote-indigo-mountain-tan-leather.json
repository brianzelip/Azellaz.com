  "body": "This is the pocket-lover's tote! It includes four outside pockets in indigo-dyed felt. Fits a laptop or tablet in addition to all of the essentials.\n\nThe felt is the highest density of industrial wool felt and will not pill. The leather is English Bridle leather that is luxurious, water resistant, and durable. It is vegetable tanned in Pennsylvania by a company that was founded in 1867, from North American cattle. Includes all brass hardware.\n\nFor cleaning, a lint roller is your best friend. You may spot clean with water and gentle detergent, but do not submerge in water. Indigo is a physical bond with wool and will fade slightly over time.\n\nApproximate dimensions: 15 inches wide x 13 inches tall x 3 inches deep.",
