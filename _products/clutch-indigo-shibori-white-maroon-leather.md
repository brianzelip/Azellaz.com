  - "Great as an evening clutch, a small crossbody bag, a pouch for organizing in a larger bag, or all three! Fits the essentials (phone, credit cards, keys). I particularly love this bag for travel as it fits compactly in a suitcase and can be used for both nights out and minimalist day trips."
  - "Each piece is hand dyed with indigo and hand waxed with beeswax. The base of the bag is made from English Bridle leather which is luxurious, water resistant, and durable; vegetable tanned in Pennsylvania by a company that was founded in 1867, from North American cattle. Includes all brass hardware and a Riri zipper."
  - "7 inches wide x 4.5 inches tall x 1.5 inches deep."
  - "Available with wrist strap, crossbody strap, or both. Make your selection from within the shopping cart."
