## Thoughts

- logo can go in middle of page
- header can go to different part of screen (like pawnea bottom left/bottom middle)
- shop filter btns as plain text in a horizontal line, add underline and color when selected
- more pages of presenting/organizing/story telling about the work and ideas of Azellaz
- remove netlify and snipcart links on footer
- add a shows page (places where Abbie has had a table)
- add a "stockists" page (places that stock Azellaz - even if ephemeral)
