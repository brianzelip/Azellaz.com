              <p class="serif">Azellaz produces handmade bags in Baltimore, Maryland. We have a strong commitment to quality materials and are guided by the desire to create functional, beautiful bags that delight as they assist in your everyday adventures. Most pieces are dyed by hand with natural dyes, and waxed by hand with beeswax (white or yellow), before sewing.</p>

              <h2 class="h1 mt0 center serif">Caring for your Bag</h2>
              <p class="serif">Waxed canvas wears a bit like leather; its qualities change over time, softening and developing a shiny patina. If your bag becomes too soft for your liking, you can stiffen it up by heating the canvas with a hair dryer. Hold the heat on each area until it darkens a bit, then reshape and allow to cool. This will also get rid of any scuff marks or creases.</p>
