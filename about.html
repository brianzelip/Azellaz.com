              <p class="serif">Azellaz produces handmade bags in Baltimore, Maryland. We have a strong commitment to quality materials and are guided by the desire to create functional, beautiful bags that delight as they assist in your everyday adventures. Most pieces are dyed by hand with natural dyes, and waxed by hand with beeswax (white or yellow), before sewing.</p>

              <h2 class="h1 mt0 center serif">Caring for your Bag</h2>
              <p class="serif">Waxed canvas wears a bit like leather, softening over time and developing a patina. If your bag becomes too soft or loses its water repellancy, it may benefit from a re-application of wax. It is generally recommended to rewax your bag every year or two if you would like to maintain its structure, but this varies based on preference. IF you'd like to rewax the bag yourself, I recommend using a bar of Otter Wax, which will produce a finish that is a bit softer and more oily than my original wax, but performs well and smells great. Or, if you’d prefer me to rewax with the original wax blend, please get in touch and I would be happy to do so for a small fee.</p>
              <p class="serif">Waxed canvas will repel liquids, preventing many stains before they happen. However, if your bag does become soiled, first try brushing the area with a dry, natural bristle brush (I again like the one from Otter Wax). If this doesn’t work, you may use some castile soap with a bit of cold water and the same brush to scrub the stain out. After drying, the area may benefit from a re-application of wax.</p>
              <p class="serif">Treat the leather as you would any other leather items, conditioning every 6 months - 1 year, and spot cleaning sparingly with saddle soap.</p>

              <h2 class="h1 mt0 center serif">Guarantee</h2>
              <p class="serif">If for any reason you are not satisfied with the durability of your bag, please let me know and I will do my best to fix the issue or replace your bag. I have put a lot of thought and care into making a durable bag, so I want to know if anything goes wrong so I that I can address it in future designs!</p>
