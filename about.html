              <p class="serif">Azellaz produces handmade bags from scratch in Baltimore, Maryland. We have a strong commitment to quality, sustainable materials and are guided by the desire to create functional and beautiful bags that delight as they assist in your everyday adventures for years to come. "Made from scratch" means that we start with bare ingredients (like white cotton duck canvas) and manipulate them into the finished products that you see, all in our home studio. Most pieces are dyed with natural dyes and waxed with a homemade beeswax blend before being sewn up.</p>

              <h2 class="h1 mt0 center serif">Caring for your Bag</h2>
              <p class="serif">Waxed canvas wears a bit like leather, softening over time and developing a patina. If you don't like the look of any light creases that may appear, you can get rid of them by heating the area with a hair dryer or by leaving the bag in a sunny window. (Heating will also temporarily stiffen your bag, so be sure to reshape while it is still warm.)</p>
              <p class="serif">If your bag becomes too soft or loses its water repellancy, it may benefit from a re-application of wax. It is generally recommended to rewax your bag every year or two if you would like to maintain its structure, but this varies based on preference. If you'd like to rewax the bag yourself, I recommend using a bar of Otter Wax, which will produce a finish that is a bit softer and more oily than my original wax, but performs well and smells great. Or, if youâ€™d prefer me to rewax with the original wax formula, please <a href="/contact" class="light-black underline">get in touch</a> and I would be happy to do so for a small fee.</p>
              <p class="serif">Waxed canvas will repel liquids, preventing many stains before they happen. However, if your bag does become soiled, first try brushing the area with a dry, natural bristle brush (I again like the one from Otter Wax). If this isn't enough, you may use some castile soap with a bit of cold water and the same brush to scrub the stain out. After drying, the area may benefit from a re-application of wax.</p>
              <p class="serif">Treat the leather as you would any other quality leather items, conditioning every 6 months - 1 year and spot cleaning sparingly with saddle soap.</p>

              <h2 class="h1 mt0 center serif">Guarantee</h2>
              <p class="serif">If for any reason you are not satisfied with the longevity of your bag, please let me know and I will do my best to fix the issue or replace it. I have put a lot of thought and care into making a durable bag, so I want to know if anything goes wrong so I that I can address it in future designs!</p>
